# Program Schedule and Overview

Welcome to Summer DH 2025! This page overviews details about the program and the [program schedule](https://github.com/cornell-colab/2025-SummerDH/blob/main/Program%20Schedule%20and%20Overview.md#schedule).

## (Digital) places we'll spend time

* The overview for each workshop, and instructions for assignments and workshop prep, will appear on this [Summer DH 2024 GitHub repository](https://github.com/cornell-colab/2024-SummerDH/blob/main/Program%20Schedule%20and%20Overview.md).
* The [discussion board](https://github.com/cornell-colab/2024-SummerDH/discussions) will be a private space to post reflections and comments. 
* The [Fellows' Folder in Box](https://cornell.box.com/s/5m9lh7988fbn2ihnjxotm7y4fu0kzeih) for collaborative documents (used most often during some workshop sessions)

## Devices
Please bring a laptop to each workshop. We will use digital tools and download software during the summer and will frequently use them. If you have any questions or concerns about having access to a laptop this summer, do not hesitate to talk to Eliza or Iliana. 

## Schedule
Here’s the schedule for the next six weeks. Each session will take place 10am – 12pm in Olin Library 701, unless otherwise noted. We plan 10-minute breaks during each session. Most workshop days will include a small assignment to do in advance, and a reflection to complete afterward. 

While some workshops will take place with the full group, many will take place with your subcohorts. Here, we've abbreviated the digital collections group name to "COLLX" and the text analaysis group's name as "TEXT."

Co-working sessions are time to work on projects individually in each other’s presence or in small groups, to ask questions, and to generate conversation, as appropriate.  All co-working sessions will be held as a full group. 

During the **mid-program presentations (Friday, June 21)**, each Fellow will informally present on their project intentions during the following three weeks. Reflect on what you'd like to accomplish by the end of the summer as well as any challenges you anticipate (and strategies for navigating those challenges). You can also ask the group questions if you'd like feedback or ideas. Plan to share for about 8-10 minutes, then receive feedback or questions for 5-7 minutes. 

The **Summer Digital Humanities Showcase (Thursday, July 11), 10am-3pm at the A.D. White House** will be the final event of the Summer DH program. During the event, you will each share out reflections on the progress you've made in your projects, as well as your key takeaways from the summer. This year, we plan to have these presentations in a panel format according to the two cohorts. We will provide lunch and refreshments this day. Please feel free to invite colleagues and friends!

## People

* **Eliza Bettinger** leads Olin Library's research and teaching services for digital scholarship in the humanities and related social sciences. Throughout the year, she collaborates with scholars and students on projects in mapping, visualization, text analysis, and digital exhibits and publishing. She also teaches students and consults with researchers across the university about issues related to digital privacy and surveillance and is a member of the Library Freedom Project. Uniting all her work is a concern for helping people make meaning from, and exercise control over, data, information, and narratives.  

* **Iliana Burgos** is the emerging data practices librarian at Olin Library. She first explored digital scholarship in graduate school, studying social inequality in U.S. cities through digital map-making and researching the community engagement practices of open data government and nonprofit programs in North Carolina. These days, she’s focused on supporting researchers in building skills with text data mining and computational text analysis methods. She is passionate about promoting critical approaches to digital scholarship and data management. A Ronald E. McNair Scholar and American Library Association Spectrum Scholar, Iliana previously supported community engagement work at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Wilmington Institute Free Library of Delaware.

* **Matt Connolly**  is an application developer in the Library's IT department and has been at the LIbrary for 17 years. He works on the library catalog, websites, and long-term digital repository. He is interested in user privacy, creating good user interfaces, and innovative search systems. He has also created experimental offline collections of digital resources for the Cornell Prison Education Program.

### Additional instructors and guests (in order of appearance)

* **Andrea Wang** is a PhD student of Information Science at Cornell University. Her research is in studying NLP for multilingual and social science research. She is especially interested in NLP for Asian languages and legal studies. Prior to joining Cornell, she had multiple experiences in data collections and engineering, including the Jail Data Initiatives and with civic-tech community in Taiwan. Andrea supports text analysis instruction for Summer DH.

## A note on research logs
We encourage you all to build the habit of keeping a research log as you work on your projects this summer (and beyond). Research logs are dedicated spaces for you to reflect on what you're learning, document your progress, record helpful resources and note questions and challenges. 

The following are general research log prompts that might help guide your thinking:
  1. **Learning:** What concepts did you learn today? What content seems especially helpful for your project?
  2. **Intention-setting**: What were your project goals today? Be explicit about what you intended to work on.
  3. **Progress:** What did you do for your project today? Did your actual work match your stated intentions?
  4. **Support:** What resources helped you accomplish your work?
  5. **Challenges:** What roadblocks are you encountering? Is anything confusing you? What do you feel uncertain about?
  6. **Questions:** What other questions or thoughts are you processing (if any)?
 
  We'll incorporate some of these prompts in our Github discussion space the first weeks of the fellowship, then emphasize them explicitly in week two. After that, you are welcome to use any other note-taking platform of your choosing(e.g., Microsoft OneNote, Google docs) to personally keep track of your process.
