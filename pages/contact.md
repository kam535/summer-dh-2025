## People

* **Eliza Bettinger** leads Olin Library's research and teaching services for digital scholarship in the humanities and related social sciences. Throughout the year, she collaborates with scholars and students on projects in mapping, visualization, text analysis, and digital exhibits and publishing. She also teaches students and consults with researchers across the university about issues related to digital privacy and surveillance and is a member of the Library Freedom Project. Uniting all her work is a concern for helping people make meaning from, and exercise control over, data, information, and narratives.  

* **Iliana Burgos** is the emerging data practices librarian at Olin Library. She first explored digital scholarship in graduate school, studying social inequality in U.S. cities through digital map-making and researching the community engagement practices of open data government and nonprofit programs in North Carolina. These days, she’s focused on supporting researchers in building skills with text data mining and computational text analysis methods. She is passionate about promoting critical approaches to digital scholarship and data management. A Ronald E. McNair Scholar and American Library Association Spectrum Scholar, Iliana previously supported community engagement work at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Wilmington Institute Free Library of Delaware.

* **Matt Connolly**  is an application developer in the Library's IT department and has been at the LIbrary for 17 years. He works on the library catalog, websites, and long-term digital repository. He is interested in user privacy, creating good user interfaces, and innovative search systems. He has also created experimental offline collections of digital resources for the Cornell Prison Education Program.
