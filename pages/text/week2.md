### Before the session

#### 1. Install Python and JupyterLab
If you haven't already, finish the pre-work sent via email before the start of Summer DH:
1. **Setting up Python and Jupyter Lab:** We will work in Python and Jupyter Lab during the fellowship. To set up, follow steps 1-3 in ["Install Python & Jupyter Lab"](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/01-Install-Python.html) section of Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python, v.1 (Walsh, 2021). You can stop following the tutorial after step 3; you don't have to download VS Code for the Summer DH program!
2. **Learning the command line:** Review "[the Command Line" lesson](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmelaniewalsh.github.io%2FIntro-Cultural-Analytics%2F01-Command-Line%2F01-The-Command-Line.html%23working-with-files-and-texts&data=05%7C02%7Citb23%40cornell.edu%7C2fe65c10d7fe41c73a3008dc816935eb%7C5d7e43661b9b45cf8e79b14b27df46e1%7C0%7C0%7C638527536077301671%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=NEbhyfxq32q%2F75OV%2FadeHRrBqu%2BxUhUXo4KpT2EEFvY%3D&reserved=0) from *Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python, v.1*. Start from the beginning of the lesson and feel free to pause when you get to the "Working with Files and Texts" section.
3. **Getting started with Python**: Download the "SDH_Python_0" file in [this shared Box folder](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcornell.box.com%2Fs%2F5m9lh7988fbn2ihnjxotm7y4fu0kzeih&data=05%7C02%7Citb23%40cornell.edu%7C2fe65c10d7fe41c73a3008dc816935eb%7C5d7e43661b9b45cf8e79b14b27df46e1%7C0%7C0%7C638527536077319460%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Hn2Tda461Kx5tSejdaJVbtjNoY0kZh%2Fcz%2Bi5ZbZfFQU%3D&reserved=0). (It's also available in the [(TEXT): Python Lessons folder](https://github.com/cornell-colab/2024-SummerDH/tree/main/(TEXT)%3A%20Python%20Lessons) on Github.) Open the file in Jupyter Lab (or your preferred programming environment, if you're used to a different software). Follow the lesson to start learning Python!
4. If time allows: Continue to SDH_Python_1 (in Python lessons folder).


### Hour one: Check-in and word counts (50 mins)
1. Check-in (15 minutes): Go around the room, share how far you've each gotten with the pre-work. What's been your experience so far? What questions are coming up?
2. Review (15 minutes): We'll go over some key ideas from Python lessons 0 and 1. 
3. First steps for word counts (20 mins): Together, we'll begin SDH_Python_2

### Hour two: Lab time
Catch up on the pre-work and Python lessons. 

### After the session
1. Write a reflection post for today's workshop.
2. Prepare readings for tomorrow's sessions.
3. Finish python lessons through SDH_Python_2 for Thursday.
