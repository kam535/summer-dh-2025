## Introductory Assignment (Before the Session)

From the [list of projects](https://github.com/cornell-colab/2024-SummerDH/blob/main/Workshops/June%2003%3A%20Introduction%20to%20DH/List%20of%20Projects.md), choose one to three projects that interest you.  
  
You'll see that there is a category for Computational Text projects, and a category for Collections Projects, which is further divided into a subcollection of multi-year, funded projects created by large teams, and a subcollection of projects created by single investigators, usually students. If you decide to focus on the Collections projects, please choose at least one each of the team and the individual projects.  

### For each of your chosen projects,
 
1. Read through and interact with the project until you have a good feeling for the project’s scope, goals, and capabilities.
2. Read any associated “About” information to get a sense of the who the project’s creators are (and how many of them there are), what tools were used in the creation, what its data sources are, and any sources of funding.

### A few questions to consider:
* Who is the intended audience of the project? Scholarly researchers, students, general public, a combination?  
* Is the project primarily meant as a secondary source -- the presentation of original research, much like an analog book or article? Or is it meant to be used as primary material for others’ research or creative work? Or is it some combination of these two types?  
* How might the project be used to generate new research questions? New answers? 
* Can you identify the source of the project's underlying data? How was the data created or where did it come from? Is it available to others as a direct download?
* How the data been processed or analyzed? Can you tell what tools were used? What methods?
* How has the data been *presented*? What storytelling choices did the creator(s) make? Can you identify the platform or tools used to create the presenting website?
* Are the project’s creator(s) writing (or have they already written) published works derived from or as accompaniments to their digital project? Look them over.
* If applicable, what explicit choices have the project's leaders made about principles governing the project's labor practices, community engagement, and data curation?  
* In what ways do find the project successful or unsuccessful?
* What are your questions about the project?

(We'll continue to refer to the projects in this list over the next few weeks.)

## During the Session:

### Schedule overview

### A note on research logs
We encourage you all to build the habit of keeping a research log as you work on your projects this summer (and beyond). Research logs are dedicated spaces for you to reflect on what you're learning, document your progress, record helpful resources and note questions and challenges. 

The following are general research log prompts that might help guide your thinking:
  1. **Learning:** What concepts did you learn today? What content seems especially helpful for your project?
  2. **Intention-setting**: What were your project goals today? Be explicit about what you intended to work on.
  3. **Progress:** What did you do for your project today? Did your actual work match your stated intentions?
  4. **Support:** What resources helped you accomplish your work?
  5. **Challenges:** What roadblocks are you encountering? Is anything confusing you? What doyou feel uncertain about?
  6. **Questions:** What questions do you have (if any)?
 
  We'll incorporate some of these prompts in our Github discussion space the first weeks of the fellowship, then emphasize them explicitly in week two. After that, you are welcome to use any other note-taking platform of your choosing(e.g., Microsoft OneNote, Google docs) to personally keep track of your process.

## After the Session: 

### 1. Reflection Post

After we've met, post a short reflection on the 2024 Fellows Discussion Board. Address any of these questions:  

* Think about the data (or sources) that will underlie your own project. What issues do you foresee you may need to address as you assemble, process, analyze, and present your data?
* What are some factors that are important to the success of a digital project that you want to replicate in your own project?  
* What do you want to understand better?  
* What do you want to know how to do? 

Consider the discussions posted by other fellows and comment as you'd like to.


### 2. Prep work for June 4 subcohort kickcoff:
* TEXT and COLLX: Review your group's respective "before the session" content in the [June 4 repository]((https://github.com/cornell-colab/2024-SummerDH/tree/main/Workshops/June%2004)).

* If you didn't get a chance to do the Introductory Assignment before Monday, do it now.
