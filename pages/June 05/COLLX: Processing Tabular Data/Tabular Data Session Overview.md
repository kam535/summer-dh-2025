# Part 1:
Read the [Data as a Worldview](https://kam535.github.io/summer-dh-2025/modules/day3/) section.

# Part 2: Intro to OpenRefine  

## Before the Session 

* **Download and Install** [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org)  
Email Eliza with any problems or questions.  

* **Read** the catalog entries for [Eastern Penitentiary Admission Book A](https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/22/) and [Eastern Peniterntiary Admission Book B](https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/21/) in *The Magazine of Early American Datasets .*

* **Download the dataset [Eastern_State_Admission_Book.csv](https://github.com/kam535/summer-dh-2025/blob/main/pages/June%2005/COLLX%3A%20Processing%20Tabular%20Data/Eastern_State_Admission_Book.csv)**  
This dataset is a combination of the two datasets that you just read about.
  * Go to the folder for today's session and click on the link to Eastern_State_Admission_Book.csv. A page will open, and you'll see a preview of the data table.  
  * Toward the upper-right, you'll see a button that says "Raw." RIGHT-click it (or Control-Click on a Mac) and choose "Save Link As."  
  * Choose a place on your machine to store the CSV file. Add the file suffix .csv to the file name if your machine doesn't automatically add it. Download the file and keep it somewhere you can find it Wednesday morning.

* **Read** the readings for our discussion with the whole cohort:

  * Davis, H. (2019). "[A Dataset is a Worldview](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-dataset-is-a-worldview-5328216dd44d)," a blog post on *Towards Data Science*, a *Medium* vertical.  
This short post is about datasets used in machine learning. But the idea that a dataset reflects a worldview is just as relevant to the creation of metadata schema as to corpus creation. 

  * Onouha, M. (2016). "[On Missing Datasets](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets)," documentation of a mixed media art installation.  
And **View** [the photos of the installation on the artist's website](https://mimionuoha.com/the-library-of-missing-datasets).

  * D’Ignazio C. and L. Klein (2020). “[The Numbers Don’t Speak for Themselves](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4660/chapter/213291/The-Numbers-Don-t-Speak-for-Themselves),” In _Data Feminism_, MIT Press.

## During the Session  




## After the Session  

Rawson, K and T. Munoz. (2016). "[Against Cleaning](http://curatingmenus.org/articles/against-cleaning/)"  
This fascinating longer essay is a touchstone piece for humanities researchers working with so-called "messy" data. Through it, you'll also learn about the "Curating Menus" collection project at the New York Public Library, which is very cool.
