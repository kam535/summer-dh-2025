The Summer Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities (Summer DH) supports a small interdisciplinary cohort of Cornell Ph.D. students who together investigate approaches to digital scholarship through collaborative workshops, readings, discussion, and co-work on independent projects. The fellowship is a project of the Digital CoLab, sponsored by Cornell University Library and the Society for Humanities.
