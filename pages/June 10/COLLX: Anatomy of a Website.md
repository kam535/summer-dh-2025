## Before the Session  

### Reading  
The reading for today is about a movement within DH called "minimal computing." [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) and [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) are both tools (static-site generators) for managing collections that were built in response to the Minimal Computing movement. They are both alternatives to large, heavier software like [Omeka](https://omeka.org/) and [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/). Like most schools of thought, minimal computing does not need to be an either/or proposition. There are many tradeoffs when choosing tools and approaches; principles of minimal computing might be one of them for you. It's a good concept to be aware of, in any case!  

* ["Minimal Definitions (tl;dr version)"](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2016/10/03/tldr/) (2016), Jentery Sayers, from the blog *Minimal Computing.*  
* ["Minimal Computing in Libraries: An Introduction"](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2017/01/15/mincomp-libraries-intro/) (2016), Stewart Varner, from the blog *Minimal Computing.*

As you think about the platform(s) you may choose for your project, review the Platform Reference Guide. For reference, I've also labeled the projects in our first-day project list with the platforms the projects use. Unlabeled projects use a custom-coded website. 

### Exercises: What are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?  
Do as many of these short exercises as you can before Monday. If you don't finish by Monday, continue working through them during the week.  
  
**Watch** "[HTML, CSS, Javascript Explained [in 4 minutes for complete beginners]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78)", a video by Danielle Thé.        
As Thé explains, every website you visit is coded using all three of these languages, and connecting them together. It's not important at this stage that you know how *write* code in any of these languages, but it *is* important that can *recognize* them. Think of a human language you don't know and that uses a completely different graphical system (or alphabet) from any language that you *do* know. Can you recognize that language if you see it somewhere? For example, in my case, I don't speak or read a single word of Korean, but I do recognize that I'm *looking* at Korean when I see a paragraph of it. Today, that's the level of literacy that is your goal for HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
  
### HTML

Open [W3 Schools HTML Code Editor: Basic Paragraphs](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default).  
  
On the left, you see a window with some HTML code in it. On the right, you see the web site created by that code.  

If you change some of the code in the left window, and hit the "Run" button, you will see a new result in the right window.  
  
Note that the code in the left window consists of two types of elements:  
  * Text that appears on the web page (e.g. "This is a paragraph.")  
  * Tags that encircle other text or tags (e.g. ```<p>```, ```</p>```, ```<body>```, ```</body>```  

Change some of the text inside the ```<p>``` (paragraph) and ```</p>``` (end paragraph) tags.  
Click "Run".  
You just coded your first web page!  
  
Now, visit and experiment with these HTML code editors:  
* [W3 Schools HTML: Basic Document](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic_document)  
* [W3 Schools HTML: Basic HTML Link](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic_link)  
* [W3 Schools HTML: Basic Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_lists_intro)  

See if you can figure out what each tag is used for.  

### CSS

Visit the [W3 Schools CSS Editor: Try CSS Syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_syntax1).
  
On the left you see some code that is *a mixture of HTML and CSS*.  
Much of what you see should be recognizable as HTML.  
But let's focus on the material that is between the ```<style>```, ```</style>``` tags. That's CSS.  
Between the curly brackets (```{}```), you'll see two instructions to the web browser of how to change the *style* of every *paragraph* (that is, all text that is tagged ```<p>```).  
Change some of the text between the curly brackets. (For example, change the text color to blue, or the alignment to left.) Click Run. 
You just styled a web page!  

Now try this one:  
* [W3 Schools CSS Editor: Try CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_default).  
  Change some of the CSS and some of the HTML, and see what happens. Can you decode most of the elements in the left window?  

### JavaScript

As Thé explained, JavaScript is the language that controls all *action* on a webpage. If HTML is the nouns and CSS is the adjectives, then Javascript is the verbs of the web. Anytime you click something a webpage, and something happens, that's Javascript in action.  

For an example, 
Visit [W3 Schools JS Editor: My first JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_myfirst).  
Experiment and see if you can read the basics of how the HTML and JS are working together.
