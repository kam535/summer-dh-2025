# Hour two (TEXT): Text analysis methods (and Andrea Wang!)

## Before the session:
1. If you haven't already, review the reading and video assigned for June 7's session. Consider the questions listed the end of the Nguyen et. al reading. Do any questions stick out to you? We can discuss further on Monday.

1. Review this brief tutorial on stopwords: "[Creating Stopwords Lists](https://github.com/ithaka/constellate-notebooks/blob/master/Stopwords/creating-stopwords-list.ipynb)" (Kelber & Lawless). You can download the file by clicking "download" on the upper right hand corner of the Github window, then opening the file in Jupyter Lab.

2. Learn about regular expressions with at least one of the following resources:
  * See an example of regular expressions being used by researcher Melanie Walsh in her tutorial, "Web Scraping -- Part 2" in [*Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python*](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/04-Data-Collection/03-Web-Scraping-Part2.html#regular-expressions)
  * Go through the tutorial: "[Understanding Regular Expressions](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/understanding-regular-expressions)" (Knox, 2020).
  * Try out the interactive "Regular Expressions" tutorial from Library Carpentry (geared toward librarian audiences, but can be fun if you have some previous experience using regular expressions)


## During the session

### 1. Introducing: Andrea Wang!

### 2. Python and homework check-in

### 3. Guiding questions as we consider methods

#### For engaging methods:
* What is the underlying argument about "where meaning lies" with this text analysis method? How might this argument speak to your project interests?

#### For your own projects:
From [Nguyen et al. (2020)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2020.00062/full)
* "Who is waiting for the answer to your question? What would knowing the answer change, both in your field of study and the wider world?"
* "Are these questions answerable with text? Are they answerable only or primarily with text? Conversely, are you missing something when you focus on text alone?"


## After the session
1. Reflection post: where meaning lies in your texts.
2. Session pre-work for Tuesday.
