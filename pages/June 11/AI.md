## Before the session:

Read the following:
1. [Chapter 2: "Labor"](https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv1ghv45t.5) in _The Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence_ (Crawford, 2021)
2. ["What is a Language Model and Why Should You Care?"](https://logicmag.io/policy/what-is-a-language-model/) (Paullada, 2023)
3. "[On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922)" (Bender et al., 2021)
4. (Optional): For those interested in the water consumption of ChatGPT, see "[Artificial intelligence technology behind ChatGPT was built in Iowa â€” with a lot of water](https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-gpt4-iowa-ai-water-consumption-microsoft-f551fde98083d17a7e8d904f8be822c4)" (O'Brien & Fingerhut, 2023)

Optional:

During the session, we will be doing some hands-on experimentation using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) and/or [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com). If you have time, try out one or both of these tools. (They can both be used without logging in or creating an account. However, creating a ChatGPT account will give you access to more features, and logging in to Copilot with your Cornell email address will enable certain privacy protections you won't get with the free version.) What are the similarities and differences between the two AI systems in terms of their features and responses? What do the companies behind them say about the privacy of your data? Can you think of ways to use these tools to help you develop your project?
